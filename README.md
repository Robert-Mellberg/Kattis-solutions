# Kattis-solutions
[Kattis](https://open.kattis.com) is a website for solving different programming challenges. Each problem requires you to write a program in your chosen language and submitting your code to the website. Kattis will run your code on some test examples, if it passes all tests you will be rewarded with points. Harder problems will award more points.

In this project i have posted all my approved solutions to kattis problems. I have split them up in three different folders depending on the amount of points they give: [Easy(1-3p)](https://github.com/Robert-Mellberg/Kattis-solutions/tree/master/Easy%20(1-3p)), [Medium(3-5p)](https://github.com/Robert-Mellberg/Kattis-solutions/tree/master/Medium(3-5p)), [Hard(5-10p)](https://github.com/Robert-Mellberg/Kattis-solutions/tree/master/Hard(5-10p)). Some of the problems in the 'Hard' folder will contain explanations at the top of the files.

If you have any questions about any of the solutions, email me at robmel@kth.se
